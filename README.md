## Abstract

To address the challenges of high user involvement and low time efficiency in handling large datasets, we propose an
enhanced interactive clustering algorithm called LR-COBRAS, which integrates logical reasoning. By applying logical
rules, the algorithm autonomously infers new relationships between data points from user-provided constraints,
significantly reducing the need for user interaction. Furthermore, LR-COBRAS introduces a dynamic super-instance
refinement process and custom data structures to adaptively adjust clustering granularity, enhancing flexibility,
accuracy, and overall time efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR100, ImageNet, and UCI datasets
demonstrate that LR-COBRAS not only reduces user interaction but also significantly improves query efficiency and time
efficiency while maintaining high clustering quality. This work presents a novel approach that leverages logical
reasoning to optimize interactive clustering, particularly for complex and large-scale datasets.The source code for our
implementation is available on https://github.com/cjw-bbxc/LR-COBRAS.
